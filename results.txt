I strongly disagree that it is an Ark clone.  There are certain aspects that are the similar or the same, but overall the game is more different than it is alike.  \n\nThe real poblem is simply this:  Cyclones.  They're unrealistic in every way, FAR too abundant, and take time away from the game.  It's too dangerous to sail until directly after a rain.  If you don't know when the last rain was, it's usually best to wait.  This takes a LOT of time away from available play time.  At the very least, as I play on a private server, put in a command that allows for the control of the number of cyclones from a ton to none.  A slider would be great, but not necessary.  Any kind of control would be better than none if it allowed for a severe reduction in their numbers.  I'd be okay if it were more like one every so often, but as it is now, and with the way they spawn, you can't really avoid them more oft than not.  It isn't uncommon to see 10 or more and they ... oddly, tend to chase you. \n\nI want to recommend this game, but sadly, I'm having trouble doing so for this reason.  The number of ghost ships is fine as far as I'm concerned.  They add an aspect of fun, but the cyclone frequency is just broken.\n\nIf something changes with the cyclones, I'll change my review.  This is the ONLY thing keeping me from recommending it currently.\n\n2/21/19 Update:  I wanted to love this game so badly.  Today, all my ships and tamed animals disappeared.  It has been a struggle against game breaking bugs from the beginning.  I've uninstalled the game.  There's no point in playing it currently.  Maybe in the future at some point.  \n\nThey did change cyclones, but they didn't decrease the number of cyclones overall, they just decreased the chance they spawn at all during a storm from 100% to 33% and they do 100% more damage.  I'd be happy with 50% chance to spawn and 50% of the number of the freaking things with 100% (double) damage. \n\nSadly, I can recommend the game less now than ever before.  Don't get this game yet.

This game came out of no where and was hyped a lot by the community. It’s a shame they had issues but hear this out:\n\nPeople are quick to jump on the hate train and usually I’m with it. I jump on hate trains all the time as game companies get away with some absolute bs these days. With that said, straight to the point, this game is AMAZING. \n\nPeople say oh this should be a DLC for ark... those people have not played the game. Of course there are many similarities like animations, models, and even weapons tools and structures, but this game plays totally differently than Ark. The pace is different(more PvP) the survivabilty against other players is different(far better) and the meta is completely and totally different.  \n\nIf sea of thieves can get away with 16 man servers and get decent reviews, I’ve lost all hope in society. That game is a $60 empty ass boring POS for casuals. Atlas is high stakes but also very highly rewarding. The innovation here is incredible too. 40,000 man servers. And it works smoothly. I will say again sea of thieves was SIXTEEN PLAYERS!!! They just didn’t make that known! \n\nFinally, the devs are very transparent and said the game will have issues as it is a $30 early access game. Love or hate the early access model, they warned everyone and the majority of complaints are either about the troublesome launch or the similarities to ark. \n\nThis game deserves a chance. It is a masterpiece. MASTERPIECE. \n\nTry it for yourself forget the haters in this one case.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nThis game/ark are masterpieces in so many ways. These games have so much potential. Unfortunately, the developers do not seem to care about small companies/tribes. The current meta is just a bunch of naked players with no gear playing hide and seek with claim flags. To someone who has no idea what that means, it might sound fun, but trust me it is absolutely not.

Após os fatos citados, o momento do lançamento total do acesso antecipado finalmente chegou, e, como se não bastasse novamente, foi um desastre TOTAL, a maioria dos usuários não conseguiram se conectar, os problemas de conexão eram gravíssimos, e aqueles que conseguiram se conectar, enfrentaram grande "Lag" de conexão (alto ping e o famoso "rubberbanding") e também péssimas taxas de FPS ("Frames per second") que se deu devido à péssima otimização. Após alguns dias, os desenvolvedores foram, aos poucos, resolvendo os problemas, hoje em dia o jogo é no mínimo jogável, mas ainda assim apresenta problemas e algumas pessoas nem mesmo são capazes de se conectar, mesmo tendo bons computadores e conexão com a internet de boa qualidade. Até aí a desculpa de que o jogo ainda é um título em acesso antecipado é aceitável, visto que todos apresentam problemas. Após os problemas de conexão serem sanados (em partes), a maioria dos usuários foi, só então, capaz de entrar e jogar.\n\n  Daqui em diante, vou contar como foi a experiência de alguém que passou mais de 400 horas jogando nos servidores oficiais, deixo claro desde já que não me "aventurei" nos servidores da comunidade, tudo o que contarei agora ocorreu nos servidores OFICIAIS do jogo.\n  Bom, continuando... Já com conexões mais sólidas e com o jogo levemente mais otimizado, comecei então a minha "aventura" em Atlas. A quantidade de bugs era simplesmente HORRENDA, chega a ser OBSCENO os acontecimentos, mas o pior de tudo, não eram apenas os bugs, os desenvolvedores conseguem PIORAR ainda mais o jogo ao tentar corrigir as falhas, fizeram muitas tentativas de correções que, ou não foram eficientes, ou trouxeram ainda mais bugs e problemas para o jogo. Só para reforçar, é simplesmente INCRÍVEL a habilidade que os desenvolvedores possuem de piorar o jogo. Como eu já citei, a quantidade de bugs e falhas são HORRENDAS que não consigo listar todas, vou listar as mais expressivas e significativas que tive o desprazer de experimentar ou, pelo menos, assistir.\n - Nos servidores PvP, de alguma forma parcela dos jogadores conseguiram acesso de administrador, se utilizando de comandos (como criar aviões da segunda guerra mundial por exemplo) para obter vantagem. Esse problema em especial causou um "rollback" de aproximadamente 6 horas no servidor NA PvP.\n - Em todos os servidores, por um certo período de tempo foi possível duplicar items.\n - Em todos os servidores, após o "update" que tornou ativo os "Ship of the Damned" estes apareciam em quantidades extremamente exageradas, eram extremamente fortes e agressivos até mesmo contra navios ancorados e inativos na costa, inclusive contra os "Shipyards" (estrutura para construir um navio). Os SotD, causaram uma destruição em massa nos jogadores, muitos perderam seus navios por motivo nenhum e já desistiram do jogo logo neste período.\n - O sistema de território, no começo era muito confuso, e até hoje é muito estragado, é possível, ao roubar o território de outro jogador, sobrepor o território que foi roubado em territórios que ainda estão ativos, capturando consideravelmente boa parte do território dos jogadores vizinhos.\n - Nos servidores PvE, era possível encher um corpo morto com muitos materiais ou passar materiais para um amigo mesmo, o que deixava muito pesado, e assim possível afundar os navios de outros jogadores por excesso de peso.\n - Nos servidores PvE, a ferramenta de reparo causava dano nos jogadores, como se PvP fosse.\n - Nos servidores PvE, era possível também acessar certas estruturas (uma fogueira por exemplo) de outros jogadores e lotar de materiais, ficando ainda mais fácil pesar os navios que tinham estruturas em cima (muito comum).\n - Ao tentar balancear as armas de fogo para os servidores PvP, fazendo as mesmas mais efetivas contra armaduras, estragaram o dano contra os animais selvagens, visto que estes eram um problema que irei citar agora.\n - A vida selvagem era TOTALMENTE desbalanceada, um animal alfa era extremamente forte, capaz até mesmo de matar um jogador com um único ataque, dependendo do caso, e ainda eram extremamente defensivos, tomando um dano muito reduzido em relação aos animais comuns.\n - Mesmo os animais comuns eram extremamente fortes, os crocodilos eram muito rápidos na água, os lobos fortes e rápidos.\n - Não vou nem entrar no assunto das "Golden Age Ruins" que são supostamente os locais de maior dificuldade do jogo, onde os bichos são ainda mais fortes e injustos.\n\nBoa parte desses bugs já foram corrigidos, mas não sem que vários outros bugs menores ocorressem e também causaram desprazeres. Consegui contornar todos os bugs, matando alfas em cima de estruturas ou usando flechas de fogo que eram muito fortes, protegendo meus navios como pude, protegendo meus territórios... Enfim, consegui ser alguém no jogo, construir várias bases e barcos, inclusive os melhores do jogo, consegui equipamentos fortes de tesouros de alto nível. Porém, me custou mais de 400 horas e uma bela saúde mental para finalmente me estabilizar, para descobrir que o jogo não tem tanto conteúdo assim, não tem muito o que fazer quando você conquista tudo o que quer e derrota o Kraken.\n\n Agora vou falar um pouco sobre o balanceamento do jogo, que também sempre foi quebrado:\n - Um jogador pelado, portando um arco com flechas de fogo (sim, um jogo de pirata onde o arco é a melhor arma, claramente aproveitado do ARK mesmo...) era capaz de OBLITERAR um jogador com armaduras de nível "Legendary" com rifles e pistolas de mesma qualidade, visto que a flecha de fogo foi, por muito tempo, a arma mais letal do jogo.\n - Os bichos domados receberam diversos "nerfs", ficando inutilizados por muito tempo. Em determinado momento, fui capaz de ver com meus próprios olhos um crocodilo alfa matar com um único ataque um tigre domado.\n - O dano das armas de fogo foi extremamente nerfado contra os animais selvagens, no começo, por exemplo, uma pistola tirava 157, foi reduzido para 126, e agora o dano base da pistola, é simplesmente 75, apenas alguns animais tomam "Headshot" os que não tomam (crocodilos por exemplo) tomam apenas o dano base, a pistola ficou bem fraca pros padrões do jogo. O Rifle atualmente tira 134 no dano base, o que é um pouco mais aceitável, mas ainda assim, mais fraco que a pistola em sua primeira versão.\n - O preço das estruturas de pedra, ficou por um tempo, inaceitável, simplesmente colocaram "organic paste" (um material que não é tão simples) como requerimento para construir estruturas de pedra, voltaram atrás nessa mudança só um belo tempo depois.\n - A fonte da juventude, que foi um desastre no seu update de lançamento, foi uma missão bem desgastante em um primeiro momento, eu sinceramente gostaria de ter filmado o que eu ví, uns 10 golems e 5 fire elementais na porta da caverna onde estava a fonte, os bichos são muito fortes, formou praticamente um corredor da morte para acessar a fonte, como se não bastasse a quantidade elevada de morcegos fortes e letais, tão como os Soldiers of the Damned, dentro da caverna, e ainda por cima, os jogadores trolls que bloqueiam o caminho, que é extremamente estreito, apenas para você morrer e não conseguir tomar da fonte até que a mesma mude de lugar.\n\n Enfim, só listei alguns dos problemas que me lembrei ao escrever esta análise, vários já foram corrigidos e muitos outros surgiram. Reforço o aviso que existem bem mais problemas que os citados. Até quando essa desculpa de acesso antecipado vai colar?\n Não recomendo, mesmo acreditando no potencial.', 'timestamp_created': 1545562569, 'timestamp_updated': 1550628107, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': False, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, {'recommendationid': '47877585', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198130811798', 'num_games_owned': 62, 'num_reviews': 4, 'playtime_forever': 3402, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'last_played': 1546408122}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "Waste of time.

I managed to farm most of the mats for our galleon during one 2x event with a bear, and elephant. This includes the max amount of gunports and cannons to fill them. Developers managed to decrease the amount of metal on large gunports by 90% making it super easy to build the biggest ship.\n\nI had to rewrite this review because its not fair for me to play this game as much as I do and enjoy it as much as I do and keep my review negative.

With that being said I have to say that it is lacking in the originality department. You see the way it works around here is either you get hard or someone gets you hard. That might not make sense but let me explain. Last summer I was on a bus ride to Somalia so help build a school on my way off the bus a kid stole my backpack and ran off. I was sad at first but I knew that the little guy probably needed it more than me. I caught up with our group guide and asked him about where I could buy a new backpack and he asked me why I needed one. I told him about the little kid and he told me that It was probably not a kid but a grown man. You see the folk of Somalia suffer from malnutrition and it causes there growth to stop at a young age. I thought about all the moments in my life that had let up to this moment and how truly blessed I was to be able to spend my time helping people less fortunate. \n\n          Later that night we arrived at the hotel. It was nothing special and there was only one bathroom down the street from us. My guide told the group that we would not have our own rooms but would sleep In rooms that can only be described as something that would be on a train. "Packed in our own little sardine cans," he said. I thought that was funny for some reason and gave out a light chuckle but no one else seemed to think it was funny. We all were tired from our long hike there and decided to fall into bed or in my case fall up to bed after all my bed was on a higher level. When I woke in the morning I was greeted to the laughter of and talking of people on the street. I thought that was funny how people that we would consider to have nothing were still able to put on a smile and greet the day with a bright new face each day. \n\n          We all got dressed and packed up our stuff. My guide even went out and got me a new backpack. For a man that lived in Somalia, he was incredibly generous for a man that worked just about every day of the year. I grabbed him by the hips and bent down and sucked the fat out of his a.s.s. He squealed with excitement as.s his fart hit my tongue. I thought it was weird how hit fart tasted like ketchup on my wet tongue as I began to explore his canal with my tongue. After breakfast, we headed out to the school we had a lot of work ahead of ourselves. Which brings us back to the game. It sucks farts just like my trip to Smolia.

I strongly disagree that it is an Ark clone.  There are certain aspects that are the similar or the same, but overall the game is more different than it is alike.  \n\nThe real poblem is simply this:  Cyclones.  They're unrealistic in every way, FAR too abundant, and take time away from the game.  It's too dangerous to sail until directly after a rain.  If you don't know when the last rain was, it's usually best to wait.  This takes a LOT of time away from available play time.  At the very least, as I play on a private server, put in a command that allows for the control of the number of cyclones from a ton to none.  A slider would be great, but not necessary.  Any kind of control would be better than none if it allowed for a severe reduction in their numbers.  I'd be okay if it were more like one every so often, but as it is now, and with the way they spawn, you can't really avoid them more oft than not.  It isn't uncommon to see 10 or more and they ... oddly, tend to chase you. \n\nI want to recommend this game, but sadly, I'm having trouble doing so for this reason.  The number of ghost ships is fine as far as I'm concerned.  They add an aspect of fun, but the cyclone frequency is just broken.\n\nIf something changes with the cyclones, I'll change my review.  This is the ONLY thing keeping me from recommending it currently.\n\n2/21/19 Update:  I wanted to love this game so badly.  Today, all my ships and tamed animals disappeared.  It has been a struggle against game breaking bugs from the beginning.  I've uninstalled the game.  There's no point in playing it currently.  Maybe in the future at some point.  \n\nThey did change cyclones, but they didn't decrease the number of cyclones overall, they just decreased the chance they spawn at all during a storm from 100% to 33% and they do 100% more damage.  I'd be happy with 50% chance to spawn and 50% of the number of the freaking things with 100% (double) damage. \n\nSadly, I can recommend the game less now than ever before.  Don't get this game yet.

They just didn’t make that known! \n\nFinally, the devs are very transparent and said the game will have issues as it is a $30 early access game. Love or hate the early access model, they warned everyone and the majority of complaints are either about the troublesome launch or the similarities to ark. \n\nThis game deserves a chance. It is a masterpiece. MASTERPIECE. \n\nTry it for yourself forget the haters in this one case.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nThis game/ark are masterpieces in so many ways. These games have so much potential. Unfortunately, the developers do not seem to care about small companies/tribes. The current meta is just a bunch of naked players with no gear playing hide and seek with claim flags. To someone who has no idea what that means, it might sound fun, but trust me it is absolutely not. The claiming system is an amazing concept but claiming flags need to be limited or your tribe should only be able to decap one flag from an enemy company at a time/have to actually sit on the flag and defend it in order to capture it.\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND UNTIL SMALL TRIBE TILES ARE ADDED OR CLAIM FLAG SYSTEM IS LIMITED/REVAMPED.', 'timestamp_created': 1546206048, 'timestamp_updated': 1550629696, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.397922933101654053', 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, {'recommendationid': '47723278', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198036680787', 'num_games_owned': 532, 'num_reviews': 126, 'playtime_forever': 21678, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 619, 'last_played': 1550190877}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "BattleEye is completely useless... chinese are all running around with 300 ping and using hacks which make it impossible to fight them in pvp.

Após os fatos citados, o momento do lançamento total do acesso antecipado finalmente chegou, e, como se não bastasse novamente, foi um desastre TOTAL, a maioria dos usuários não conseguiram se conectar, os problemas de conexão eram gravíssimos, e aqueles que conseguiram se conectar, enfrentaram grande "Lag" de conexão (alto ping e o famoso "rubberbanding") e também péssimas taxas de FPS ("Frames per second") que se deu devido à péssima otimização. Após alguns dias, os desenvolvedores foram, aos poucos, resolvendo os problemas, hoje em dia o jogo é no mínimo jogável, mas ainda assim apresenta problemas e algumas pessoas nem mesmo são capazes de se conectar, mesmo tendo bons computadores e conexão com a internet de boa qualidade. Até aí a desculpa de que o jogo ainda é um título em acesso antecipado é aceitável, visto que todos apresentam problemas. Após os problemas de conexão serem sanados (em partes), a maioria dos usuários foi, só então, capaz de entrar e jogar.\n\n  Daqui em diante, vou contar como foi a experiência de alguém que passou mais de 400 horas jogando nos servidores oficiais, deixo claro desde já que não me "aventurei" nos servidores da comunidade, tudo o que contarei agora ocorreu nos servidores OFICIAIS do jogo.\n  Bom, continuando... Já com conexões mais sólidas e com o jogo levemente mais otimizado, comecei então a minha "aventura" em Atlas. A quantidade de bugs era simplesmente HORRENDA, chega a ser OBSCENO os acontecimentos, mas o pior de tudo, não eram apenas os bugs, os desenvolvedores conseguem PIORAR ainda mais o jogo ao tentar corrigir as falhas, fizeram muitas tentativas de correções que, ou não foram eficientes, ou trouxeram ainda mais bugs e problemas para o jogo. Só para reforçar, é simplesmente INCRÍVEL a habilidade que os desenvolvedores possuem de piorar o jogo. Como eu já citei, a quantidade de bugs e falhas são HORRENDAS que não consigo listar todas, vou listar as mais expressivas e significativas que tive o desprazer de experimentar ou, pelo menos, assistir.\n - Nos servidores PvP, de alguma forma parcela dos jogadores conseguiram acesso de administrador, se utilizando de comandos (como criar aviões da segunda guerra mundial por exemplo) para obter vantagem. Esse problema em especial causou um "rollback" de aproximadamente 6 horas no servidor NA PvP.\n - Em todos os servidores, por um certo período de tempo foi possível duplicar items.\n - Em todos os servidores, após o "update" que tornou ativo os "Ship of the Damned" estes apareciam em quantidades extremamente exageradas, eram extremamente fortes e agressivos até mesmo contra navios ancorados e inativos na costa, inclusive contra os "Shipyards" (estrutura para construir um navio). Os SotD, causaram uma destruição em massa nos jogadores, muitos perderam seus navios por motivo nenhum e já desistiram do jogo logo neste período.\n - O sistema de território, no começo era muito confuso, e até hoje é muito estragado, é possível, ao roubar o território de outro jogador, sobrepor o território que foi roubado em territórios que ainda estão ativos, capturando consideravelmente boa parte do território dos jogadores vizinhos.\n - Nos servidores PvE, era possível encher um corpo morto com muitos materiais ou passar materiais para um amigo mesmo, o que deixava muito pesado, e assim possível afundar os navios de outros jogadores por excesso de peso.\n - Nos servidores PvE, a ferramenta de reparo causava dano nos jogadores, como se PvP fosse.\n - Nos servidores PvE, era possível também acessar certas estruturas (uma fogueira por exemplo) de outros jogadores e lotar de materiais, ficando ainda mais fácil pesar os navios que tinham estruturas em cima (muito comum).\n - Ao tentar balancear as armas de fogo para os servidores PvP, fazendo as mesmas mais efetivas contra armaduras, estragaram o dano contra os animais selvagens, visto que estes eram um problema que irei citar agora.\n - A vida selvagem era TOTALMENTE desbalanceada, um animal alfa era extremamente forte, capaz até mesmo de matar um jogador com um único ataque, dependendo do caso, e ainda eram extremamente defensivos, tomando um dano muito reduzido em relação aos animais comuns.\n - Mesmo os animais comuns eram extremamente fortes, os crocodilos eram muito rápidos na água, os lobos fortes e rápidos.\n - Não vou nem entrar no assunto das "Golden Age Ruins" que são supostamente os locais de maior dificuldade do jogo, onde os bichos são ainda mais fortes e injustos.\n\nBoa parte desses bugs já foram corrigidos, mas não sem que vários outros bugs menores ocorressem e também causaram desprazeres. Consegui contornar todos os bugs, matando alfas em cima de estruturas ou usando flechas de fogo que eram muito fortes, protegendo meus navios como pude, protegendo meus territórios... Enfim, consegui ser alguém no jogo, construir várias bases e barcos, inclusive os melhores do jogo, consegui equipamentos fortes de tesouros de alto nível. Porém, me custou mais de 400 horas e uma bela saúde mental para finalmente me estabilizar, para descobrir que o jogo não tem tanto conteúdo assim, não tem muito o que fazer quando você conquista tudo o que quer e derrota o Kraken.\n\n Agora vou falar um pouco sobre o balanceamento do jogo, que também sempre foi quebrado:\n - Um jogador pelado, portando um arco com flechas de fogo (sim, um jogo de pirata onde o arco é a melhor arma, claramente aproveitado do ARK mesmo...) era capaz de OBLITERAR um jogador com armaduras de nível "Legendary" com rifles e pistolas de mesma qualidade, visto que a flecha de fogo foi, por muito tempo, a arma mais letal do jogo.\n - Os bichos domados receberam diversos "nerfs", ficando inutilizados por muito tempo. Em determinado momento, fui capaz de ver com meus próprios olhos um crocodilo alfa matar com um único ataque um tigre domado.\n - O dano das armas de fogo foi extremamente nerfado contra os animais selvagens, no começo, por exemplo, uma pistola tirava 157, foi reduzido para 126, e agora o dano base da pistola, é simplesmente 75, apenas alguns animais tomam "Headshot" os que não tomam (crocodilos por exemplo) tomam apenas o dano base, a pistola ficou bem fraca pros padrões do jogo. O Rifle atualmente tira 134 no dano base, o que é um pouco mais aceitável, mas ainda assim, mais fraco que a pistola em sua primeira versão.\n - O preço das estruturas de pedra, ficou por um tempo, inaceitável, simplesmente colocaram "organic paste" (um material que não é tão simples) como requerimento para construir estruturas de pedra, voltaram atrás nessa mudança só um belo tempo depois.\n - A fonte da juventude, que foi um desastre no seu update de lançamento, foi uma missão bem desgastante em um primeiro momento, eu sinceramente gostaria de ter filmado o que eu ví, uns 10 golems e 5 fire elementais na porta da caverna onde estava a fonte, os bichos são muito fortes, formou praticamente um corredor da morte para acessar a fonte, como se não bastasse a quantidade elevada de morcegos fortes e letais, tão como os Soldiers of the Damned, dentro da caverna, e ainda por cima, os jogadores trolls que bloqueiam o caminho, que é extremamente estreito, apenas para você morrer e não conseguir tomar da fonte até que a mesma mude de lugar.\n\n Enfim, só listei alguns dos problemas que me lembrei ao escrever esta análise, vários já foram corrigidos e muitos outros surgiram. Reforço o aviso que existem bem mais problemas que os citados. Até quando essa desculpa de acesso antecipado vai colar?\n Não recomendo, mesmo acreditando no potencial.', 'timestamp_created': 1545562569, 'timestamp_updated': 1550628107, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 0, 'steam_purchase': False, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': True}, {'recommendationid': '47877585', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198130811798', 'num_games_owned': 62, 'num_reviews': 4, 'playtime_forever': 3402, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 0, 'last_played': 1546408122}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "Waste of time.

With that being said I have to say that it is lacking in the originality department. You see the way it works around here is either you get hard or someone gets you hard. That might not make sense but let me explain. Last summer I was on a bus ride to Somalia so help build a school on my way off the bus a kid stole my backpack and ran off. I was sad at first but I knew that the little guy probably needed it more than me. I caught up with our group guide and asked him about where I could buy a new backpack and he asked me why I needed one. I told him about the little kid and he told me that It was probably not a kid but a grown man. You see the folk of Somalia suffer from malnutrition and it causes there growth to stop at a young age. I thought about all the moments in my life that had let up to this moment and how truly blessed I was to be able to spend my time helping people less fortunate. \n\n          Later that night we arrived at the hotel. It was nothing special and there was only one bathroom down the street from us. My guide told the group that we would not have our own rooms but would sleep In rooms that can only be described as something that would be on a train. "Packed in our own little sardine cans," he said. I thought that was funny for some reason and gave out a light chuckle but no one else seemed to think it was funny. We all were tired from our long hike there and decided to fall into bed or in my case fall up to bed after all my bed was on a higher level. When I woke in the morning I was greeted to the laughter of and talking of people on the street. I thought that was funny how people that we would consider to have nothing were still able to put on a smile and greet the day with a bright new face each day. \n\n          We all got dressed and packed up our stuff. My guide even went out and got me a new backpack. For a man that lived in Somalia, he was incredibly generous for a man that worked just about every day of the year. I grabbed him by the hips and bent down and sucked the fat out of his a.s.s. He squealed with excitement as.s his fart hit my tongue. I thought it was weird how hit fart tasted like ketchup on my wet tongue as I began to explore his canal with my tongue. After breakfast, we headed out to the school we had a lot of work ahead of ourselves. Which brings us back to the game. It sucks farts just like my trip to Smolia. By the way, the school burned down and all the kids died including that one f.uck-er who stole my backpack rest in species you little sh,i.t.', 'timestamp_created': 1545523343, 'timestamp_updated': 1550540764, 'voted_up': True, 'votes_up': 0, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': 0, 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': True, 'written_during_early_access': True}, {'recommendationid': '48016279', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198026364461', 'num_games_owned': 148, 'num_reviews': 21, 'playtime_forever': 22704, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 4143, 'last_played': 1550898953}, 'language': 'english', 'review': "Further updating my review after a few hundred hours of gameplay. \n\nAvoid.
